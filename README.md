# rate-iq-grades
analyziz of correlation between ratings in game and GPA of students in university

iq is big concept related with all parts of our life, although many scientists deny the possibility of assessing life successes in a standardized form for everyone, iq as the most researched concept in psychology and social engineering seems to have not only correlation but also casual relationship with our life decisions and achievements, and I look at it as very good instrument.

#how data is designed:

rating:
since game has 27 ratings, first i tried to descript rating from 1 to 27, but 27th rating-mythical glory is in fact not one but a lot of different rates, depending how many stars they have. so I describe rating through  amount of stars player have at all

gpa:
gpa represented as gpa shown in my.alatoo.edu.gov

important notes:
since its not possible to know all players in ala-too this cant be taken as serious research

since were asked only ala-too students this is not random sample

since a lot of asked students are only freshmans, were taken only their gpa in fall semester 2023

this research doesn't show casual relationship between grades and ratings, it shows only correlation between them


main goal of this "research" is to show that casual relationship of iq with grades and ratings makes them have correlation.
